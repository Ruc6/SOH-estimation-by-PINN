Through this work, I learned how Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate governing differential equations into neural network training to achieve accurate solutions with limited data, and implemented PINNs for exponential decay and simple harmonic motion problems. I also gained hands-on experience with battery modeling using PyBaMM, where I studied lithium-ion battery behavior through the Single Particle Model, analyzed lithium concentration dynamics, and derived the OCV–SOC relationship to understand battery State of Health (SoH)
